__E__lectronic __C__ourse __R__eserves __U__nleashed!

A course reserves information management system that provides a RESTful API for accessing course and reserves information.


__ecru__ uses a [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/index.html) 4 instance that functions as a NoSQL database, taking advantage of [Solrj](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/Solrj) for creating, updating, and modifying the data.  An [Apache Tomcat](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/index.html) instance supports both the RESTful API and the Solr database.

Begun as a Harvard University [Library Lab](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab)  project (funded with the generous support of the [Arcadia Fund](http://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/) ) .
