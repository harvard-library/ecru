This directory contains the configuration and other files needed to be placed underneath
SOLR_HOME.

Note that we are using the "core discovery" [version 4+] method of defining 
the solr core(s).

The files in *this* directory are placed as follows:


SOLR_HOME/solr.xml
SOLR_HOME/{collection name -- currently V1}/core.properties


See the solr/conf/README for details on the components that go in the
SOLR_HOME/{collection name }/conf/
